The repository contains files to support my project which is to analyse the rental prices in the Seattle area to 
advise a fictional client on where they should buy a property to put for rent to customers.

There are 4 main files:
- Udacity_seattlev6.ipynb - this is a jupyter notebook with the main source code for my project
- 3 data files called listings.csv.zip, calendar.csv.zip and reviews.csv.zip

The 3 data files above:
 - taken from Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data): per the Kaggle website it describes each file as follows:
 - Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
 - Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
 - Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

The main source file (Udacity_seattlev6.ipynb) when run in jupyter notebook will extract the other 3 files and give
the user various analysis.
